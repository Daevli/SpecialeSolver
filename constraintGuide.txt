============================
How to add hard constraints:
----------------------------
Add lines of integers to the file "hardConstraints.txt". Each line represents a constraint and starts with a constraint-index
followed by the arguments that describe the desired constraint. e.g.
1 2 3
means constraint index 1 with arguments 2 and 3. See below for details.
============================
Each type of constraint has a constraint-index:
#1 : Hard complementary constraint, phase 1
     -- Description:
	"Two teams cannot play Home in the same round (probably due to shared stadium)."

     -- Arguments: 
	team1, team2

     -- Example: 
	1 6 7
	Teams 1 and 2 cannot play home in the same round

     -- Notes:
	This will only be enforced in the first half of the tournament
----------------------------
#2 : Hard availability constraint, phase 1
     -- Description:
	"A venue might not be available due to other events, so the associated team cannot play a homegame in a given round.
	Can also be used to force a team to play home in a given round."

     -- Arguments: 
	team, forced H or A, round

     -- Example:
	2 4 0 2
	Team 4 must play away in round 2

     -- Notes:
	Home/Away is indicated by 1/0. 1 means the the team must play home, while 0 means that the team must play away.
----------------------------
#3 : Hard pairing constraint 1, phase 2
     -- Description:
	"These two teams must NOT play against eachother in a specific round."

     -- Arguments: 
	team1, team2, round

     -- Example:
	3 1 2 1
	Team 1 and 2 must NOT play in round 1

     -- Notes:
	As is, it is not possible to ban multiple rounds per matchup. 
	E.g. it is not possible to have teams 2 and 3 not play in rounds 1, 2 and 3. (Even with multiple #3 constraints)
----------------------------
#4 : Triple constraint, phase 1
     -- Description:
	"At most two of these three teams can play homegames in the same round. This could be because the stadiums are
	close to eachother and three simultaneous home games would overload public transport or the like."

     -- Arguments: 
	team1, team2, team3

     -- Example:
	4 1 3 5
	At most two of teams 1, 3 and 5 can play home in a round

     -- Notes:
	This hard constraint is very constrictive, so consider using the soft version.
----------------------------
#5 : Hard pairing constraint 2, phase 2
     -- Description:
	"These two teams MUST play in a specific round."

     -- Arguments:
	team1, team2, round

     -- Example:
	5 1 3 7
	Team 1 and 3 MUST play against eachother in round 7

     -- Notes:
